# @estoc/daemon-api

The public contract between an Estoc daemon and its views: the web app,
a terminal, a bot. A view installs this package and nothing of the
daemon side; the daemon adapts its domain results into the shapes
declared here. Records decide nothing: the daemon rechecks every
operation when it executes.

| Entry point | What it owns |
| --- | --- |
| `@estoc/daemon-api/contract` | Identifiers, the published state, the snapshot's records, runtime lines, the method table, error codes, the bootstrap exchange, the application frames, protocol constants, and a schema for each |

The types and JSDoc of the entry point define the API. The `schemas`
namespace holds a zod schema per declared type; each is annotated with
the type it produces, so the declarations and the runtime checks cannot
drift apart. Unknown members of a record are ignored, message bodies
pass through with every key kept, and an error code the schema does not
know still reads as a failure with the effect it states.

`pnpm consumer-check` packs the package, installs it into an empty
project outside the workspace, compiles and runs a small view against
it with no Node or DOM types, and fails when any package of the daemon
side came along.

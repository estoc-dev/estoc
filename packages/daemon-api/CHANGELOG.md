# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — Unreleased

The contract between an Estoc daemon and its views, as one package a
view installs alone.

- `@estoc/daemon-api/contract`: API-owned identifiers, the published
  state value with its phases and holds, the normalized snapshot and its
  records, runtime lines and log lines, the method table with each
  method's named input, result, outcome subset and known error codes,
  the stable error codes, the bootstrap exchange and the application
  frames, protocol constants, and a zod schema for each of these.
  Message bodies pass through with every key kept; display times are
  checked as instants, not spellings only; a channel is referred to by
  its ID and never taken apart.
- `scripts/consumer-check.mjs`: installs the packed package outside the
  workspace, compiles and runs a view against it, and fails when any
  daemon-side package came along.
